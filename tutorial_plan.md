- Inside this folder, make a file called "places.txt" and write inside it some bars/places/resturaunts you like, and why. Try to have each on just one line
- View the file with cat to make sure everything has been saved correctly
- Go back to the "terminal tutorial" folder (hint: "." represents the current folder, ".." represents the folder one above you)
- Make a new folder called "cool stuff" - Note that you'll need " " to create something with spaces inside!
- copy your places.txt file over to "cool stuff"
